- 🎓 I’m currently enrolled in a Data Analytics & Visualization certification bootcamp at the University of Denver. Regardless, I am also looking for apprenticeships either in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, or Software Engineering. I am passionate about Big Data, but also about Software Engineering. However, my endgoals are to become either a Data Engineer, Software Engineer, or Visualization Specialist. While my Bachelor's is incomplete. I am of the mind that we never stop learning, thus I intend to keep on furthering my academic education. My University backgrounds are in Industrial Design and PR, Marketing, and Applied Communciations. Guess what? I'm bilingual too!

- 👋 Hola! I’m "Missha" @vara-co
- 👀 Some of my interests include, but are not limited to: Discovering the wonders of the world. Using technology to make life more enjoyable. And visualizations as art that can inspire others to aspire further.
- 🎓 I’m currently enrolled in a Data Analytics & Visualization certification boot camp at the University of Denver.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will give me hands-on experience in the programs I've been learning for Data Analytics. Perhaps be a little ambitious and get into an internship where I can also network with some creatives and amazing individuals.
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-vara-co/
- ⚡ Fun fact: My brain comes up with very funny ideas sometimes, to the point that I can laugh hysterically in my sleep. That's how funny my thoughts can be. I believe this might be my superpower.
- ⚡ On that note, I can also come up with very inspiring words that will motivate individuals around me. The right combination of words can create, but also destroy. I'd rather create and enjoy the process of accomplishment.

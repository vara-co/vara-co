- 👋 Hola! I’m "Missha" @vara-co
- 👀 Some of my interests include, but are not limited to: Discovering the wonders of the world. Using technology to make life more enjoyable. And visualizations as art that can inspire others to aspire further.
- 🎓 I’m currently enrolled in a Data Analytics & Visualization certification bootcamp at the University of Denver. Regardless, I am also looking for apprenticeships either in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, or Software Engineering. I am passionate about Big Data, but also about Software Engineering. However, my endgoals are to become either a Data Engineer, Software Engineer, or Visualization Specialist. While my Bachelor's is incomplete. I am of the mind that we never stop learning, thus I intend to further my academic education. My University backgrounds are in Industrial Design and PR, Marketing, and Applied Communciations. Guess what? I'm bilingual too!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will give me hands-on experience in the programs I've been learning for Data Analytics. Perhaps be a little ambitious and get into an apprenticeship where I can also network with some creatives and amazing individuals.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My brain comes up with very funny ideas sometimes, to the point that I can laugh hysterically in my sleep. That's how funny my thoughts can be. I believe this might be my superpower.
- ⚡ On that note, I can also come up with very inspiring words that will motivate individuals around me. The right combination of words can create, but also destroy. I'd rather create and enjoy the process of accomplishment.

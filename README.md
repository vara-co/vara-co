    - Using technology to make life more practical and enjoyable.
    - And visualizations as art, which can inspire others to aspire further.
- 🎓 I’m currently enrolled in a Data Analytics & Visualization certification bootcamp at the University of Denver. Regardless, I am also looking for apprenticeships either in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, or Software Engineering. I am passionate about Big Data, but also about Software Engineering. However, my endgoals are to become either a Data Engineer, Software Engineer, or Visualization Specialist. While my Bachelor's is incomplete. I am of the mind that we never stop learning, thus I intend to keep on furthering my academic education. My University backgrounds are in Industrial Design, and PR, Marketing, and Applied Communciations. Guess what? I'm bilingual too!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with amazing individuals. As a team, we can build greatness.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I think my creative approach to life is my superpower. From thinking outside the box to solve problems, to creating a fun environment, to inspiring individuals around me. I humbly believe that we can accomplish anything if we truly put our minds to it. I think this is why I can learn almost anything. Except driving. I'm a bad driver. Please don't ask me to drive, lol.

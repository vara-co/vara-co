👋 ¡Hola! I’m "Missha", an aspiring Engineer.

**Tech Certifications:** <br>
- [Tech Certifications backing up some of my skills](https://github.com/vara-co/Tech-Certifications/tree/main)<br>
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-vara-co/
 
- Some of my interests include, but are not limited to:
    - Discovering the wonders of the world.
    - Using technology to make life more practical and enjoyable.
    - And visualizations as art, which can inspire others to aspire further.


- I’m currently enrolled in a Data Analytics & Visualization certification bootcamp at the University of Denver. Regardless, I am also looking for apprenticeships either in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, or Software Engineering. I am passionate about Big Data, but also about Software Engineering. However, my endgoals are to become either a Data Engineer, Software Engineer, or Visualization Specialist. While my Bachelor's is incomplete. I am of the mind that we never stop learning, thus I intend to keep on furthering my academic education. My University backgrounds are in Industrial Design, and PR, Marketing, and Applied Communciations. Guess what? I'm bilingual too!

- Fun fact: I think my creative approach to life is my superpower. From thinking outside the box to solve problems, to creating a fun environment, to inspiring individuals around me. I humbly believe that we can accomplish anything if we truly put our minds to it. I think this is why I can learn almost anything. Except driving. I'm a bad driver. Please don't ask me to drive, lol.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with amazing individuals. As a team, we can build greatness.

It's part of who I am! ![littleCloudRain](https://github.com/vara-co/vara-co/assets/152572519/0663c89b-53fd-468a-bce4-6608d178b71c)
